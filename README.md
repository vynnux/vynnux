### Hello, I am Vinicius Lopes 👋
Hello, and welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Vinicius Lopes, a developer who likes working with cutting-edge technologies. Here you'll find some of my projects, ranging from cloud computing to web development. Feel free to explore, contribute, or reach out for any collaboration opportunities.

### 🚀 **Technologies I Use**

I use pretty much everything that piques my interest, but here are the ones I use most frequently. 

#### **Containers & Orchestration 🐳⚙️**
- **Docker & Kubernetes (K8s), Containerd**: I use these tools for building, shipping, and running applications in containers, ensuring scalability and efficiency in deploying containerized applications.

#### **Cloud Computing ☁️**
- **10+ years of AWS suite**: I have extensive experience with the AWS ecosystem, including EC2, Lambda, RDS, S3, and more, enabling me to build and maintain cloud-native applications at scale.

#### **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) ⚙️📦**
- **Terraform, Helm, Ansible**: I use these tools to automate infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, and deployment, ensuring that environments are reproducible and scalable.

#### **Observability & SRE 📊🔍**
- **Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, Signoz**: I monitor and observe applications' health and performance, setting up custom dashboards, alerting, and tracing to ensure high availability and reliability.

#### **CI/CD 🔄🚀**
- **Bitbucket Pipelines, GitHub Actions**: I implement continuous integration and deployment pipelines to automate testing, building, and deploying applications, ensuring fast and reliable delivery of new features.
- **SonarQube**: I use this tool to perform static code analysis, ensuring that the code is maintainable, secure, and of high quality.

#### **Development 💻⚙️**
- **NodeJS, Golang, and React**: I work extensively with JavaScript/TypeScript (NodeJS) for backend services, Golang for performance-critical applications, and React for building modern user interfaces.
- **Architectures**: I implement and design systems using architectural patterns such as    
    - **CQRS**
    - **Clean**
    - **DDD**
    - **Ports and Adapters**


- **Design Principles**:I like applying **SOLID** principles to write clean and modular code (SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP).
- **Some Design Patterns**: Some design patterns I frequently use to improve code maintainability and flexibility include:
    - **Creational**: Factory, Singleton, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype.
    - **Structural**: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Facade, Flyweight.
    - **Behavioral**: Observer, Strategy, Decorator, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, State, Template Method, Visitor.

#### **Databases 💾🗄️**
- **MongoDB, MySQL, Redis**: I work with these databases to handle data storage and retrieval for applications. MongoDB is for NoSQL needs, MySQL for relational databases, and Redis for caching and real-time data management.

#### **Service Communication 🔗📡**
- **Kafka, AMQP (RabbitMQ), SQS, gRPC, GraphQL, WebSockets**: I use these technologies to manage communication between distributed services, handling messaging, event streaming, and real-time updates.

#### **Other Projects I Like 🌟**
- **Istio**: A service mesh that provides traffic management, security, and observability for microservices.
- **Keda**: A Kubernetes-based event-driven autoscaler, allowing automatic scaling based on external events.
- **Karpenter**: A Kubernetes cluster autoscaler that scales workloads efficiently based on demand.
- **K6**: A modern load testing tool to test the performance of APIs and applications.
- **ArgoCD**: A declarative GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.
